Case Study Roadmap

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members

1. Ask

1.1 Identify the business task
Questions: 
	1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
	2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
	3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Business Tasks:
	1. Analyse the patterns and behaviors of annual members and casual riders of Cyclicist bikes from June 2022 to May 2023;
	2. Identifying the key features and benefits of Cyclistic annual memberships that attract casual riders;
	3. Assessing the marketing channels and strategies used to target casual riders.

1.2 Consider key stakeholders
	1. Cyclistic, bike-share program
	2. Lily Moreno, director of marketing
	3. Cyclistic marketing analytics team
	4. Cyclistic executive team

2. Prepare

2.1 Data ROCCCs:
	1. is credible, aparently collected automatically via Cyclist system, but with null values
	2. is reliable, downloaded from the source site
	https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
	3. is original
	4. is comprehensive, have the information needed, althought not directly related to the user_id
	5. is current, from may 2023 backwards
	6. is cited, used in other projects

2.2 Data Storage and Credibility
	1. The data was downloaded and stored in Google Cloud Plataform's Big Query and manipulated with SQL, with a changelog to follow. 
	2. The data has enough columns to provide insights and solutions to the business tasks.
	3. The data range from june 2022 to may 2023. 
	
3. Process

3.1 Tools
	Used Big Query to manipulate the data, R and Tableau to create visualizations, considered the main tools in Data Analytics, and that provide fast paced workflow.
	
3.2 Adjustments:
	1. Considering the import of data in GCP, runned queries to process the data.
	
	2. query to create column names
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN ride_duration INTERVAL,
ADD COLUMN day_of_week INT;

	3. query to insert values into columns
UPDATE 
  `cyclist-portfolio-392022.cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202303`
SET
  ride_duration = CAST(SUBSTRING(CAST((ended_at - started_at) AS STRING),7) AS INTERVAL),
  day_of_week = EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM started_at)
WHERE
  1 = 1;

	4. query to create compiled table from all months

CREATE TABLE cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled AS
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202206
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202207
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202208
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202209
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202210
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202211
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202212
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202301
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202302
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202303
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202304
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_202305;

	5. query to change null values to N/A
UPDATE cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled
SET rideable_type = COALESCE(rideable_type, 'N/A'),
    start_station_name = COALESCE(start_station_name, 'N/A'),
    end_station_name = COALESCE(end_station_name, 'N/A')
where
  1 = 1
  
4. Analyze:

4. 1. Discoveries
	1. The data was queried in various ways to provide insights, and visualization of trends and patterns.
	
	2. query to summarize by ride count and duration average:

SELECT
  AVG(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN ride_duration END) AS avg_ride_duration_member,
  AVG(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN ride_duration END) AS avg_ride_duration_casual,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN ride_id END) AS count_ride_casual,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN ride_id END) AS count_ride_member,
FROM
  `cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled`
  
	3. query to summarize rides by lnt and lng by casual riders from geopoints with more than 1k rides 

SELECT
		COUNT(*) AS ride_count,
    start_lng,
    start_lat,
		start_station_name,
		AVG(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN ride_duration END) AS avg_ride_duration_casual
FROM
    cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled
WHERE
		member_casual = "casual"
GROUP BY
    start_lng,
    start_lat,
		start_station_name
HAVING 
		ride_count > 1000
ORDER BY
		ride_count DESC

	4. query to count the total rides by casuals for geopoints with more than 1k rides 

SELECT
    SUM(ride_count) AS total_ride_count
FROM (
SELECT
		COUNT(*) AS ride_count,
    start_lng,
    start_lat,
		start_station_name,
		AVG(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN ride_duration END) AS avg_ride_duration_casual
FROM
    cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled
WHERE
		member_casual = "casual"
GROUP BY
    start_lng,
    start_lat,
		start_station_name
HAVING 
		ride_count > 1000
ORDER BY
		ride_count DESC
)

	5. query to retrieve redieable_type

SELECT
  rideable_type,
  SUM(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sum_rides_casual,
  SUM(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sum_rides_member
FROM
  cyclist_portfolio.cyclist_12months_compiled
GROUP BY
  rideable_type;
  
4.6. Understandings
	1. From June 2022 to May 2023, casual riders spent 126.2% longer in their rides with 34.3% less rides started, compared to member riders
	2. In the same timespan, 0.04% of the geopoints accounted for 47.98% of the rides started by casual riders.
	3. From November to March, casual riders rode under a fifth (17.7%) of their average, while member riders maintained nearly half (43.4%).

4.7 Conclusions:
	1. Casual riders ride longer but less frequently and in specific geopoints;
	2. November to March are not commonly used by casual riders;
	3. Electric bikes are prefered by casual riders;
	4. During at least half of the year, casual riders maintain the same usage pace as member riders.

5. Share:

The visualizations done in Tableau and R are both very useful, but the dashboard in Tableau provides more control to the user and interactivity.
The visualizations on R lack the same beauty but provide precise insights.

6. Act
	6.1 Recommendations
	1. Focus marketing media strategies on specific geopoints that attract casual riders, with better infrastructure and offering incentives for membership, considering they have the same usage pace of members;
	2. Promote the use of electric bikes, preferred by casual riders, highlighting its benefits, in marketing materials and offering special promotions or discounts for electric bike rentals;
	3. Intensify marketing efforts, from April to October, more favorable for outdoor activities, with targeted advertising campaigns, social media promotions, and partnerships with local events or organizations.
	4. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is advisable to collect and analyze additional data, particularly by tracing the usage history of individual casual riders and incorporating external data sources.
